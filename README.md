### NodeJS AND ExpressJS
NodeJS is a runtime environment for JavaScript based on Chrome's V8 engine. JavaScript is traditionally a frontend language which was only executed in the web browser. NodeJS allows you to run JavaScript programs without a browser and provides a standard library for building HTTP servers and interface with your local machine/ operating system. Theoretically, it's JVM for JavaScript. *ExpressJS* is a NodeJS library which simplifies the creation of complex HTTP servers. Unlike Django, NodeJS/ ExpressJS apps are very lightweight and do not come with features such as authentication or ORM, hence _this section is only recommended for people who are familiar with backend development and JavaScript's asynchronous programming_.

#### Learning NodeJS as an environment
- [NodeJS Fundamentals](https://webapplog.com/node-js-fundamentals-a-concise-overview-of-the-main-concepts/) is enough to get you started for ExpressJS.
- [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/) is good for learning what comes with NodeJS.
- [NPM Tutorial](https://vegibit.com/node-package-manager-tutorial/). Node Package Manager, NPM, is used for downloading third-party packages for your project. There are a lot of concepts in NPM compared to Python's PIP, such as local packages and the package.json file. However you'll only need 3 commands in the beginning.
- nodejs.org documentation is confusing for new comers. However the [API reference](https://nodejs.org/api/) is good for a cheatsheet.

#### Documentation
- [ExpressJS Documentation](http://expressjs.com) can be completed in a day provided you are familiar with JavaScript as a language.
- You will also need MongoDB knowledge in the future, along with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) as an ORM library.

#### Tutorials
- [Nodeschool.io](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) has the best in-depth interactive tutorials.
- [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/) is always good for beginners.
- [MDN's ExpressJS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) is a more advance guide.

#### Courses
- [Microsoft's NodeJS Course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-nodejs-4) covers Express and Mongoose (for Mongo).

#### Videos
- [NetNinja's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp) covers everything.

## Advanced Topics

So, you've spent (or as some may call it, wasted)  time developing web/android apps but while you like programming, you want to work on something more challenging. If that sounds like you, welcome to our "Advanced Topics" section! It is still a work in progress but we are constantly adding more resources. If you would like to add (or remove) a resource, please feel free to create a PR.

Before we proceed, please keep in mind that these are advanced topics (as the name clearly states) in computer science (coz that's where all the money is). Trying to jump into these topics without any programming/basic math background may lead to tears and heartbreak.  Okay maybe not. But you would have to spend more time than the average user on the topics.

**TL;DR:**   If you want to learn advanced topics, you've come to the right place (section). If you don't have a strong math background, you might have to work harder but it is very doable. Best of luck!

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves making the computer understand human language (Text and Speech). Most of human knowledge is stored in the form of text (Wikipedia and others). But that text only makes sense to humans. Imagine the possibilities if a computer could know more than one human could in their lifetime. Still not convinced?  Think of Alexa, Siri and other assistants. All of these use some form of NLP!

You may choose to either start from the basics of NLP and gradually move to deep learning or you could directly jump to applying deep learning techniques to NLP (if you have a machine learning background) and then once you see how cool NLP is, you could (read should) go back and learn the basics of NLP without all the fancy neural networks.

#### Courses

1. [Natural Language Processing](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/) by Jason Eisner, Johns Hopkins University. While video lectures aren't available for the course, you should definitely go solve all the assignments. They are very tough and will strengthen your NLP foundations. You can go through the suggested readings (on the course page) if you need help with homework. (Strongly recommended)
2. [Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiyVNMpDLKnZYBTUOlSI9mi9wAErFtFm) by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning, Stanford University.  Both the professors have written two separate text books on NLP. This was a coursera course but it is no longer offered. Sadly, there are no assignments available for the course. You could choose to watch these videos and solve the homework from the first course.
3. [Deep Learning for NLP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) by Richard Socher and Christopher Manning, Stanford University. It is a great deep learning course even if you aren't interested in NLP. The course provides an introduction to deep learning and how to apply it for text data. Make sure you do the [course assignments](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments.html). Also as mentioned earlier, if you decide to start with the course and like NLP, you should most definitely do at least one of course 1 and 2.

#### Books

1. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Dan Jurafsky and James Martin. Great book. Available for free. Doesn't cover deep learning

**Note:** Please make sure to implement at least one project once you are fairly comfortable with NLP. You could either use Deep Learning or just stick to the traditional techniques. Or you could do both and compare the two methods :P

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.

Machine Learning today is one of the most sought-after skills in the market. A lot of Software Engineers are picking up ML, simply because it is a highly paid skill.
So, how do you go about Machine Learning?

•	First things first - the prerequisites:

o	Basic calculus. In Machine Learning, you’d be working on a lot of optimizations that require knowledge of Calculus. It would be highly recommended that you are aware of functions, limits, differentiation, maxima, minima, etc.

o	Linear Algebra. When you talk about ML, you will be dealing with matrices and vectors every day. So, knowledge of Linear Algebra is a must. However, you’d also be required to know about other important topics like Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.

o	Probability. Most ML algorithms try to “model” the underlying phenomena that generated the observed data. All of this modelling is probabilistic. It is therefore highly recommended that you are comfortable with the theory of Probability.

•	Getting into actual ML:

#### Courses

1.	[Machine Learning]( https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng. on Coursera. It is the best course there is, on this topic, and takes you slowly and efficiently through all the different algorithms like, Regression, Classification, to name a few. Once you finish this about 8-week long course, you should be ready to start taking up small ML projects of your own for practice. The Octave/MATLAB assignments are pretty outdated, though. Python based projects on ML are recommended.

2.	[Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) as provided by Google, is also a good way to step into the world of ML. However, it is, as its name suggests, a crash course, and would not go as into depth as the Coursera one does. So, if you’re in a hurry, try this one out, and you’ll be done in almost a week or two!

3. [The Complete Machine Learning Course with Python](https://www.udemy.com/machine-learning-course-with-python/) by Udemy with help you build a Portfolio of 12 Machine Learning Projects with Python, SVM, Regression, Unsupervised Machine Learning & More! It's costlier than most courses though, but given the wide variety of teaching styles, including project-based ones, and versatility with Python, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, et cetera, it's safe to say it is well worth it! There are occasional discounts though, so make heavy use of them.

#### Tutorials 

1. [Machine Learning with Python Tutorial series](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/) on pythonprogramming.net is an in-depth and practical machine learning hands-on course. It aims to give you a wholistic understanding of machine learning, covering theory, application, and inner workings of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms. It covers linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks, using Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, et cetera. What's more, it's free!

#### Books

For those of you, who prefer to learn & understand through a good, thorough read:

1. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) or PRML by Ian Bishop is hands down the best ML book in existence! The book is thorough on whatever concepts needed, be it purely mathematical or programming. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, including lecture slides as well as the complete set of figures used in the book, and you are encouraged to visit the [book web site](http://research.microsoft.com/∼cmbishop/PRML) for the latest information. There are some complementary volumes to this, which implement ML through MATLAB.

2. [Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~gabis/ml/ml-books/McGrawHill%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20-Tom%20Mitchell.pdf) by Tom Mitchell, as published by McGrawHill, is another introductory text on primary approaches to machine learning and
the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It introduces all basics concepts from statistics, artificial intelligence, information theory, and other disciplines as the need arises, with balanced coverage of theory and practice, and presents major algorithms with illustrations of their use, which aids quick learning. This book also provides chapterwise exercises. Online data sets and implementations of several algorithms are also available.

3. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%2520Sixth%2520Printing.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj0mv-ywc_fAhUG448KHWwzB-wQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw0z2p5-mAH6aG7kIA7XB2yc) with applications in R by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie & Robert Tibshirani. The Python implementations of the same can be found [here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python). This is a great book to begin with, as the authors give precise, practical explanations of what methods are available, and when to use them, including explicit R code. Anyone who wants to intelligently analyze complex data should own this book.
As a textbook for an introduction to data science through machine learning, there is much to like about ISLR. It’s thorough, lively, written at level appropriate for undergraduates and usable by nonexperts. It’s chock full of interesting examples of how modern predictive machine learning algorithms work (and don’t work) in a variety of settings.

4.	[Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/091117.pdf) by David Barber. 
Speaking of Bayesian statistics, this one is a classic. This takes a Bayesian statistics approach to machine learning. A book worth checking out for anyone getting into the machine learning field. 

5. [Understanding Machine Learning](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. This book gives a structured introduction to machine learning. It looks at the fundamental theories of machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these concepts into practical algorithms. Following that, it covers a list of ML algorithms, including (but not limited to), stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning.


**Note:** Please do take up ML projects. The best way to learn Machine Learning is to actually apply it to real datasets and solve real problems. Machine Learning is as much of an art as it is a science. You will learn it from experience. Your focus should be on attempting multiple ML projects so as to gain experience and build a strong profile.


Topics to come: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Cybersecurity and maybe HCI
