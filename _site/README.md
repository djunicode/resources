# Resources

List of resources to get started with software development. 

## Languages

### Python

Python is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. For a beginner diving into the world of programming, Python is arguably the most beginner-friendly and versatile language to start with.

#### Tutorials

- [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) teaches Python in depth, everything from syntax to the extensive standard library.
- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) is a quick start course intended for people coming from a programming background. If you're used to verbose languages like Java and C/ C++, this course will give you a taste of Python.
- [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) is good for introduction to programming.

## Web

### HTML AND CSS
HTML defines the structure of a web page. It forms the skeleton of the web page. Right from head to ~~toe~~ footer. CSS is used to add styling to the web page.

1.  [FCC HTML5 and CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map-aside#nested-collapseHTML5andCSS)
2.  [CodeAcademy HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

### JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is the programming language of the web. It allows adding dynamic content to static web pages. Recently, with the advent of Node.JS, it is also being used on the server side.

#### Books
1. [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) It provides an in depth explanation of all the core JS concepts finally ending with an introduction to Node.

#### Tutorials
1. [30 day JS challenge](https://javascript30.com/)
2. [Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

####  Libraries
1. [Javascripting](https://www.javascripting.com/), a great source of javascript libraries and frameworks.


### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

## Advanced  Topics

So, you've spent (or as some may call it, wasted)  time developing web/android apps but while you like programming, you want to work on something more challenging. If that sounds like you, welcome to our "Advanced Topics" section! It is still a work in progress but we are constantly adding more resources. If you would like to add (or remove) a resource, please feel free to create a PR. 

Before we proceed, please keep in mind that these are advanced topics (as the name clearly states) in computer science (coz that's where all the money is). Trying to jump into these topics without any programming/basic math background may lead to tears and heartbreak.  Okay maybe not. But you would have to spend more time than the average user on the topics.

**TL;DR:**   If you want to learn advanced topics, you've come to the right place (section). If you don't have a strong math background, you might have to work harder but it is very doable. Best of luck!

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves making the computer understand human language (Text and Speech). Most of human knowledge is stored in the form of text (Wikipedia and others). But that text only makes sense to humans. Imagine the possibilities if a computer could know more than one human could in their lifetime. Still not convinced?  Think of Alexa, Siri and other assistants. All of these use some form of NLP! 

You may choose to either start from the basics of NLP and gradually move to deep learning or you could directly jump to applying deep learning techniques to NLP (if you have a machine learning background) and then once you see how cool NLP is, you could (read should) go back and learn the basics of NLP without all the fancy neural networks. 

#### Courses

1. [Natural Language Processing](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/) by Jason Eisner, Johns Hopkins University. While video lectures aren't available for the course, you should definitely go solve all the assignments. They are very tough and will strengthen your NLP foundations. You can go through the suggested readings (on the course page) if you need help with homework. (Strongly recommended)
2. [Natural Language Processing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQiyVNMpDLKnZYBTUOlSI9mi9wAErFtFm) by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning, Stanford University.  Both the professors have written two separate text books on NLP. This was a coursera course but it is no longer offered. Sadly, there are no assignments available for the course. You could choose to watch these videos and solve the homework from the first course.
3. [Deep Learning for NLP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) by Richard Socher and Christopher Manning, Stanford University. It is a great deep learning course even if you aren't interested in NLP. The course provides an introduction to deep learning and how to apply it for text data. Make sure you do the [course assignments](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments.html). Also as mentioned earlier, if you decide to start with the course and like NLP, you should most definitely do at least one of course 1 and 2.  

#### Books

1. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Dan Jurafsky and James Martin. Great book. Available for free. Doesn't cover deep learning

**Note:** Please make sure to implement at least one project once you are fairly comfortable with NLP. You could either use Deep Learning or just stick to the traditional techniques. Or you could do both and compare the two methods :P 



Topics to come: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Cybersecurity and maybe HCI
